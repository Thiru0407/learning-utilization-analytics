## Business Context
Organizations invest heavily in training, but participation and learning outcomes often vary widely across employee groups. Understanding *who learns best, how they learn, and where learning breaks down* is critical for improving ROI on training programs.

Terra Nova Learning Academy (TNLA) sought to evaluate how employees engage with learning programs globally and identify opportunities to improve completion and learning gains.
